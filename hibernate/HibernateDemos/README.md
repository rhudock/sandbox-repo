HibernateDemos
==============

These Hibernate ORM projects demonstrate performance tips/tricks, as well as lesser-known (but extremely powerful) features.  They're intended for live presentations, but can certainly be used standalone.  Demos include:

* Fetching Strategies: "when" (laziness) and "how" (fetch style)
* Value Generation: annotations allowing in-memory and DB generated properties, both for INSERT and INSERT/UPDATE actions
* Multi-Tenancy: multiple, concurrent databases and clients from a single Hibernate instance
* Caching: entity second level cache (2LC) and query cache
* Envers: historical/audited data
* Spatial: geographical data
