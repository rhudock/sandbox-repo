Idea started to recreate [gibbed's](http://blog.gib.me/) Borderlands TPS (and presumably also BL2) save editors in Electron instead of using C#/WPF/Caliburn which cannot work on other OS' besides Windows with .NET. The idea is to make the save editor work on Linux and Mac as well.

This is currently just a visual prototype and does not actually function as a save editor yet.  I need help actually migrating some of the code to read and process save files.

### Dependencies
* NodeJS
* Electron
